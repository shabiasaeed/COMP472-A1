# COMP 472-Assignment 1

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to experiment with Machine Learning by applying various algorithms to analyze two distinct datasets using the scikit-learn library. Using Penguin data set, predicting penguin species from physical characteristics and using Abalone data set to classify abalones by sex based on their physical descriptions. Both datasets are trained and tested with 4 different classifiers: Base-DT, Top-DT, Base-MLP, and Top-MLP.

## Running the Project
Before running this notebook, make sure to run the following command to install all of the required libraries needed to execute the code properly.

`pip install -r requirements.txt --user`

**NOTE:** However, if you installed your Python installation globally, e.g. inside C:\Program Files\Python311 (and not in C:\User\%Appdata\Python311), remove the ***--user*** argument.

After opening the Jupyter notebook in your IDE of choice, press Run All to run all cells sequentially.
Please note that some cells take longer than others as the model tries its best to learn.
The entire notebook takes roughly 1-2 hours to run, depending on your machine.
